You might ask so what is this guide? This is a reformatted version of Aelarr's guide for Vicn's VIGILANT mod for Skyrim that I did to make it easier to read. This guide is the same with the .txt version in Nexus, (and ofc it's not updated to version 1.7.x yet)
> [Original Aelarr's VIGILANT guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11894/)

> [VIGILANT SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849/)

# ABOUT THE MOD

VIGILANT places you in the role of a newest recruit of the Vigilants of Stendarr. The mod consists of 4 acts or chapters, each containing its own main quest, and while the first act simply sends you on a few run-off-the-mill 
simple tasks for the Vigilants, the story very quickly takes a darker turn when a very certain Daedric Prince takes an unhealthy amount of interest in you. Will you remain defiant to the end ... or will you submit?

VIGILANT may take a lot of influences from Dark Souls, but it nevertheless deals with the established Elder Scrolls lore. If you are familiar with it, you might appreciate the mod's unique spin on the Alessian lore, Towers,
Shezarr, nods to the previous TES games and ESO (don't complain, it's a perfectly fine game) and much more. But remember, this mod will very quickly stop holding your hand. Nothing will be served to you on a silver platter, 
and this guide does not offer explanations about the story. For that, you will have to wait for the full guide.

Each act of the mod contains its own main questline which can consist of one or more quests. Lower number of quests does not necessarily mean less content, though. In act 1 and 2 there are still plenty of quest markers and 
instructions, but in act 3 you will have to find the clues yourself and act 4 finally completely drops both quest markers and visible quests in your journal. There is also a unique gameplay mechanic - KARMA. Throughout your 
playthrough you will gain or lose karma, depending on your decisions, quest completion and who you kill. At the end of the mod amount of total karma will decide whether you will immediately receive a bad ending or have a chance
for a better one (or an even worse one - this is possible, too). Karma is especially important in act 4, where you can also gain (or lose) the largest amount of it.

You can technically start the mod at any level, but I'd really recommend you to wait at least until you're level 40 or more. It's doable on a lower level with some luck, very good gear or exploiting the game (which I obviously
don't recommend), but bosses at the end of acts 1 and 2 and throughout acts 3 and 4 will most likely just wipe the floor with you. If you are a roleplayer, I also recommend finishing anything that has to do with Molag Bal before
(this means his Daedric quest in vanilla Skyrim, potentially the entire Dawnguard DLC and any mods you may have that feature him). Why? Because VIGILANT is meant as a sort of finale to the whole Molag Bal VS Dragonborn conflict
(if you do go for conflict, of course). And while the mod doesn't force you into any role, it still makes the most sense to play as a Dragonborn.

Also, if you have access to it, bring Dawnbreaker with you. Most of the enemies count as undead, and that sword can help you immensely (especially if you have a mod that buffs it further, like Dawnguard or Daedric Dawnbreaker).
And another thing - if you have any basic needs mods installed (like iNeed or Realistic Needs and Diseases), you may want to either stock up on food and water, turn that functionality off or prepare to starve for the duration
of acts 3 and 4. There is next to no food in those two acts, you can't really buy it and you'll be stuck in their respective places until you finish the quests.

Another word of warning regarding followers: VIGILANT is meant to be a solo adventure and while nothing stops you from taking a follower (or an army of them) with you, they may prove to be more trouble than they are worth.
There are some sections of the mod where they won't be able to follow you and at least for acts 3 and 4, it really doesn't make much sense to have anyone with you storywise. But then again, this is your game. ;)

VIGILANT is a dark story. It will drag your character (and possibly you, too) through hell and back, but it's very worth it. 

I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

# WALKTHROUGH
**Mod start: in Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar**

## ACT 1
> Note: Any mods that automatically clean corpses may be incompatible in a game breaking way - you will not be able to complete quest 7 - THUS SPOKE KHAJIIT if a certain corpse vanishes from the game.

### 1 - VIGILANT OF STENDARR
- when you step into the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar, Altano will talk to you and invite you into the Vigil
- accept Altano's offer and follow him outside Danwstar to the Temple of Stendarr
- talk to Thorondir in the Temple
- talk to Altano
- can optionally explore the temple (Gwyneth in the library sells some general Vigilant items and there are crafting stations to the right of the main entrance)

### 2 - BLOODSUCKER 
- talk to Altano, then follow him or meet him in the Whiterun Hall of the Dead
- objective is to find the vampire (Lusine): she's in the Bannered Mare from 6am to 9pm (you can also talk to Jo'vanni there for a little info)
- after 9pm she'll move to the top of the stars leading to Cloud district from the Drunken Huntsman, talk to her there at night and accept her offer of "sweetrolls"
- Lusine transforms into a gargoyle/vampire hybrid and attacks (kill her, obviously)
- return to Altano in the Hall of the Dead

### 3 - HE WHO CANNOT BE TOUCHED
- talk to Altano in the Bannered Mare (you can also talk to Jo'vanni again, then he leaves for Riften)
- objective is to deal with the summoned Daedra (Vernaccus) outside Whiterun (at the abandoned house near Western Watchtower - this house is actually restored until this quest and an old thief called Winch lives there)
- Altano will follow you there
- Vernaccus will get hammy no matter what you say to him, but he's a complete pushover (even the other Daedra think he's a moron, just read Vernaccus and Bourlor book)
- defeat him, obviously

### 4 - LAZY AFTERNOON 
- talk to Altano in the Bannered Mare
- there's another Daedra (Kathutet) in the Candlehearth Hall in Windhelm -> you can follow Altano or meet him there
- Kathutet is completely non-hostile and won't even bother fighting you, but you still have to swing at him
- even Altano will complain about Kathutet's incompetence

### 5 - THE EYE OF MADNESS
- talk to Altano in the Candlehearth Hall
- there is a strange man in Kynesgrove -> Balor in Braidwood Inn -> go talk to him
- DECISION (no karma gain/loss yet, but it gets morally grey):
	- kill him immediately and return to Altano
	- leave him alone, return to Altano and try to talk some sense into him, return to Balor and kill him then (no, you have no option to spare him)

### 6 - DINE AND DASH 
- talk to Altano in the Candlehearth Hall -> he's got news from his mentor (Jacob) at Stendarr's Beacon
- follow Altano or meet him there
- Jacob has some news on the summoner responsible for all the circus and another Daedra (Amkaos) in Riften 
- follow Altano or meet him in the Bee and Barb
- Amkaos wants more food -> defeat him
- Keerava will want you to pay for everything Amkaos ate - 1000 gold! (you can nag Altano for 800 gold and he won't be very happy about it, but who cares)
- return to Jacob at Stendarr's Beacon

### 7 - THUS SPOKE KHAJIIT
- talk to Altano, then meet him in the Ragged Flagon in Riften
- objective is to find a Khajiit (Jo'vanni) who summoned a Daedra
- Jo'vanni is in the Ratway Warrens and will attack you after yelling some nonsense at you -> kill him
- after killing him, you black out and wake up in Jo'vanni's mind (you will even have Khajiit-like dialogue options)
- talk to Campaner'Ra at the fireplace
- sit at the table and talk to Campaner'Ra until she disappears
- Mar'so appears at the tanning rack, talk to him until he disappears
- a Daedra (Empusa) appears -> defeat it
- you black out again and wake up next to Jo'vanni's corpse
- go to Candlehearth Hall in Windhelm and confront Mar'so
- he will attack you -> kill him and loot Campaner'Ra's pelt from him
- return to Riften, Ratway Warrens and put Campaner'Ra's pelt in Jo'vanni's inventory
- return to Altano, who's impressed with your work (he freaking should be, he didn't lift a finger to help ...)

### 8 - OLD GUILTS
- return to Stendarr's Beacon
- summoner's mercenary will forcegreet you there and attack you if you try to get past him -> kill him and loot the key to Stendarr's Beacon Basement from him
- unlock the latch leading to the basement
- talk to Jacob, Altano will go on ahead
- follow Altano when you're done talking to Jacob, Jacob will follow you
- when you reach the bridge, Altano and Jacob will go ahead without you, follow them
- fight with the summoner (Bal/Rahel) and her two Daedra after a short scene
- loot Mace of Molag Bal from her and give it to Altano

### 9 - NO MERCY
- Altano sends you to deal with the witches near Ivarstead (if they even are that ... he's very bloodthirsty all of a sudden)
- entrance to Witch's Pond just N of Alchemist's Shack and S of Ivarstead (may be called Witch's Overlook on your map)
- Carene and Lilian inside the shack at the end of the pond area
- talk to Carene -> DECISON!
- KARMA LOSS: 
	- start the conversation with "I am a Vigilant of Stendar..." -> Carene immediately panics and attacks you and you have to kill both of them
	- or kill them both after you're done talking with them if you start with another dialogue option
	- you receive Curse of Stendarr (stamina regeneration is blocked/extremely slowed down)
- KARMA NEUTRAL:
	- start conversation with "What are you doing here?" and talk to them normally
	- return to Altano and tell him there are no witches in Ivarstead
	- you can relent and accept his reasoning at any time and return to finish the job (back to karma loss path)
	- or you can continue the argument and eventually he'll attack you
	- you black out, wake up in that shack with Carene and Lilian dead (strongly implied you killed them under Altano's influence), receive Curse of Stendarr anyway
- in either case, the real witch (Reyda) waits outside and you can talk to her for some explanations and insults
- no, you can't attack her (yet)
- no, you can't get rid of the curse (yet)

### 10 - THE ENDLESS FALL
- confront Altano in the Temple of Stendarr
- everyone dead, Altano sics his Daedra on you and vanishes
- defeat the Daedra and search for survivors
- Gwyneth in the library, behind the last row of bookcases
- go to Stendarr's Beacon and go into the basement back to where you fought the summoner
- you'll meet some ghosts on your way
- Altano summons Molag Bal (dragon form), who bites down on him and tosses him away like a ragdoll (to the utter shock and surprise of absolutely no one), then talks to you -> DECISION!
- KARMA LOSS:
	- submit to Molag Bal ("I offer you my soul..." dialogue option)
	- continue this guide with ACT 4 (yes, you've read that right -> this option skips half of the entire mod)
- KARMA GAIN:
	- defy Molag Bal ("Begone..." and "I said, begone..." dialogue options) -> leads to boss battle
	- CAUTION: Molag Bal is immune to fire based magic and will wipe the floor with you if you're too low level or just acting stupid
	
### 11 - THE LANDING
- talk to Altano after the battle with Molag Bal
- destroy the Mace of Molag Bal at the altar (just hit it with a weapon or spell)
- Molag Bal talks to you and threatens that he'll be watching you -> receive Mark of Molag Bal (strangely enough, it's a buff instead of debuff)
- return to the Temple of Stendarr
- you become the new Keeper, receive Horn of Stendarr (just a sort of symbolic badge of office)
- Curse of Stendarr lifted
- you can optionally go back to Witch's Pond and deal with Reyda now, but otherwise act 1 completes here

### 12 - THE WITCH OF IVARSTEAD
- if you so decide, you can return to the Witch's Pond and confront Reyda after The Landing
- yes, she does work for Molag Bal (and she's pretty smug about it, too)
- yes, you can tell her you'll kill her now -> boss battle starts
- Reyda will teleport around and sic Baliwogs and Grummites on you while taunting you (she actually says a lot of foreshadowing for the future) -> just hit her whenever you get a chance
- after the battle she'll beg you to spare her (where's all that smugness now, huh?) -> DECISION!
- KARMA LOSS:
	- spare her (... you can't be serious ... 0_o)
	- she disappears and reappears at the entrance to the Pond, gloats at you about you being an idiot and how she'll destroy Ivarstead (seriously, what did you expect?)
	- she's not bluffing -> she sends Grummites there and by the time you arrive (if you decide to stop her), everyone not essential will be dead
- KARMA GAIN:
	- ignore her lies and tell her that her fate is sealed
	- she attacks again, so kill her (obviously)

## ACT 2
> Note: Empty Cells is an overarching quest and continues through Loose Ends and The Blood Matron. The latter quest is only available depending on the right decision at a certain point. 

### 1 - EMPTY CELLS
- talk to Windhelm Guard outside the entrance to the Temple of Stendarr
- talk to Jorleif in the Windhelm Palace -> he wants you to investigate some strange disappearances from the prison dungeons
- a new dungeon through Windhelm Barracks
- approach the statue of a maiden in one of the cells (the largest one)
- return to Jorleif and tell him about the statue
- return to the Temple of Stendarr and find Windhelm Report 4E 180 -> in the middle shelves in the library (2nd bookshelf right in the middle, you can also ask Gwyneth for help)
- read the report and return to Jorleif
- go back into the dungeon and open a passage through the maiden statue with vampire blood (received together with the report)
- follow the passage until you reach the part with an orc vampire feeding at the well (Gwaji gro-Agnam)

### 2 - LOOSE ENDS
- Gwaji attacks, kill him and loot the key to Hidden Passage from him -> opens the door directly ahead, but that's just a shortcut back -> you need to go down the Bloody Well
- another vampire (Paulo) sees you and freaks out, runs away -> chase him down and loot key to Old Windhelm Slums from him
- go back to the circular room where Paulo ran away form you and unlock the door to Old Windhelm Slums behind the ladder you came down from
- Old Windhelm is a pretty large cell, but very linear as to where you have to go - there are many locked doors that mostly serve as shortcuts back and you will unlock them later
- enemies are mostly Feral Vampires (gargoyle/vampire hybrids)
- at the end of the cell a giant Vampire Brute guards the door -> kill it (KARMA GAIN) and loot the key to Old Windhelm City from it (unlocks the door it was guarding)
- follow the path you can (again, locked doors are shortcuts) until you reach another giant vampire (Nightmare of Ilinalta) before lowered gate
- kill it (KARMA GAIN) and loot Windhelm Guard's Old Key from it and unlock the gate leading to the door to Asylum
- Asylum is pretty labyrinthine and full of vampires, but you need to reach the room with a lantern on the table on the 1st floor
- talk to Thingol in the cell -> Jericho attacks from behind, deal with him, loot Jailor's key from him and talk to Thingol again 
- he asks you to kill him and while you can decline his wish, you will be forced to kill him anyway if you try to talk to him again (and only his death will make the quest advance, too)
- after Thingol's death a hall opens to the North of Asylum (only a wall there before) and leads to Palace of the Temptress (unlock with Jailor's key)
- follow the path until you reach a half ruined hall with some vampire and gargoyle statues - gate to the left leads back to the Old Windhelm City
- right across the hall (from the entrance) is the path ahead, large dining hall
- 2 rooms ahead Aredhel talks to you and attacks you, kill him and loot Aredhel's key from him (Loose Ends quest completes with Aredhel's death)

- unlock the door to the right with Aredhel's key
- ignore Relief of the Maiden (statue, doesn't do anything) and enter Matron's Chamber -> hall with a coffin and a woman (Lamae) lying in it in the middle
- approach the coffin -> you're lifted up, skewered with spikes and black out
- you wake up with Lamae standing next to you -> she wants you to go with her to her father's castle and is really confused if you don't recognize her (you're inside her dream, so just go along with it for now)
- just go through the valley until you reach a castle (it's really foggy here)
- and guess who's waiting right at the entrance of the castle? (seriously, did you really expect Molag Bal to just give up on you?)
- Lamae now has a vampire face
- Molag Bal tries to talk you into accepting Lamae and vampirism, if you talk to him (he's really playing a matchmaker between you two here ... and no, it's not nearly as funny as it sounds; it's actually incredibly disturbing)
- Lamae wants you to join her -> DECISION!
- KARMA LOSS: 
	- answer Lamae with "Yes, let's go." dialogue option
	- enter the castle (you can still attack Lamae before that and go for karma neutral path)
	- touch the altar -> karma loss, Blood of Lamae gained (buff again, strangely enough, and no, you don't become a vampire) -> continue this guide with ACT 4 (yes, you're skipping part of the mod with this option)
- KARMA NEUTRAL:
	- answer Lamae with "Begone, monster." (or attack her if you already agreed to her offer)
	- Molag Bal disappears, boss battle with Lamae starts -> she'll turn invisible and sic vampires on you (just strike her whenever you have a chance, also, fire magic makes her partly visible)
	
### 3 - THE BLOOD MATRON
- defeat Lamae
- after her boss battle you gain Blood of Lamae anyway and wake up back in the Matron's Chamber, and Lamae is now a desiccated corpse in the coffin -> loot Bard's Dagger from her (trust me, you'll need it in a minute)
- approach the door you came from -> spectral Molag Bal will appear on the throne at the top of the stairs, revive Lamae and sic her on you
- fighting Lamae is pointless as Molag Bal will just keep reviving her, so run to him and strike that smug bastard with the Bard's Dagger (it's the only weapon that will actually work on him)
- KARMA GAIN and quest completes

- return to Jorleif (you can either backtrack through the entire Old Windhelm or find a much shorter shortcut through the Old Well next to Asylum, which will lead you directly outside Windhelm)
- Jorleif rewards you with some money and the quest (Empty Cells) completes
- you can now return back to Old Windhelm and Matron's Chamber, where Lamae's old servant (Facis) will now reside and trade with you (he'll also warn you that you seriously pissed off Molag Bal by granting Lamae her final death - 
  No, really, Facis? I thought he'd want to congratulate me! /s)
- act 2 completes here

## ACT 3
> Note 1: If Gwyneth doesn't have any new dialogue when you return from Windhelm, exit and re-enter the Temple of Stendarr (just exiting should actually start the quest).

> Note 2: You will be stuck in the mansion until you complete the quest, so if you're using any basic needs mods (like iNeed or similar), stock up on food and water - there is next to nothing here. Or prepare to starve. Your choice.

> Note 3: This part of the mod contains horror elements (think Silent Hill). It's mostly the atmosphere and there are no real in-your-face jumpscares (at least for my standards), but keep this in mind.

### 1 - CHILD OF OBLIVION
- talk to Gwyneth in the Temple of Stendarr -> she wants to send you to the Bruiant Mansion in Chorrol, to help a Vigilant (Bartholo) who was sent there a few months before and investigate what happened there (all the contact 
  with him was lost for a while due to civil war in Skyrim and then they suddenly got a letter asking for help from him while you were off in Windhelm fighting the vampires)
- carriage waits outside the entrance to the Temple -> you can ask M'que for some more info, then activate the back of the carriage to travel to the mansion
- an Ayleid servant (Bal) waits in front of the entrance to the mansion (he really, REALLY wants you to get inside -> even your character is immediately suspicious about him)
- you don't really have any other option, so enter the mansion (Bruiant Mansion South Wing)
- congratulations, the door won't open anymore and you're stuck here now
- also, kiss all the map markers and objectives goodbye -> your objective is basically to dispel the curse on the mansion and you'll have to find 5 totems of Molag Bal and dispel the curse within them to do so 
  (basically, kill the boss guarding the altar of Molag Bal and dispel the sigil stone on it)
- a child (Julius) is at the top of the stairs and vanishes when you approach
- Marcus Bruiant's corpse on the floor right below the stairs - take his key and note (obviously, read it if you want to have any clue what's even going on)
- you can only go to the left of the stairs at the moment (door to the right is locked), so do so
- on the first turning you will see Julius in the hall to the right (leads to the courtyard which is still locked), but you need to go upstairs
- to the left are some bedrooms and hall to the basement (locked), so go to the right and unlock Marcus' room with the key you got from him -> Julius inside
- pick up Marcus' Journal (4E 201) and Bartholo's Journal from the table (some more clues on the incidents in the mansion)
- bloodstains behind the table and around the cupboard -> the first totem Bartholo writes about in his journal on the floor -> activate it and you're teleported within it (Blood Curse of Shivering)

- Blood Curse of Shivering:
	- rust (and blood?) everywhere (does it remind you of the Otherworld in Silent Hill, too?) -> some doors may be very well masked by all the rust
	- about the enemies: generally, small ones can be killed but tend to be stupidly tough (Lalorburo, Malaburo, Sunnaburo ...), while the big ones (Joraneburo, Graviaburo, Balaburo) ... don't bother with them, just run or hide
	- beware the beds on the walls (no, I'm serious -> spikes or flying -buros will randomly shoot out of them at you)
	- if you want, you can explore and find some letters and clues
	- get to the boss room with the altar of Molag Bal and Shivering Sybilla guarding it -> boss battle
	- after the battle, activate the sigil stone on the altar -> curse dispelled, receive key to Servant Room and teleport back to Marcus' room
	
- return to the main hall (where you found Marcus' corpse) and unlock the door to the right of the stairs now (leads to servants' quarters)
- clear the ground floor first -> Julius appears in the hall to the left -> go here
- unlock second room (Bal's room) to the left with the key to Servant Rooms -> a few notes on the cupboard and bloodstains behind the bed -> another totem (Blood Curse of Corruption)

- Blood Curse of Corruption:
	- large room with stupid many floors and giant bonfire at the bottom -> keep going upstairs, you may have to do some awkward parkour at times ... and beware the beds (I'm really not joking ... I wish I was)
	- boss room at the top with Melena the Unclean -> boss battle
	- dispel the altar after the battle -> receive key to Julius' Room and teleport back to Bal's room
	
- go upstairs to the 2nd floor of the servants' quarters and unlock Julius' room (first room on the right) with the key you just got
- it's full of toys :)
- Julius appears before the table with the key to basement -> grab it
- however, creatures now start crawling around this part of the mansion and one may just sneak up behind you and greet you with a loud shriek the moment you grab the key -> red witch (Julia)
- about these creatures: they are invincible so don't even think about attacking them, they will chase you, they can open doors, the screen blurs and your stamina drops to the bowels of hell if you so much as look at them, 
  their shrieking staggers you ... and if you think you can cheat with god mode, think again -> THEY KILL YOU RIGHT THROUGH IT. WHEN YOU HEAR THEIR RATTLING AND SCREAMING, FINISH WHAT YOU'RE DOING AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND FUCKING
  RUN LIKE HELL, DON'T STOP AND DON'T LOOK BACK.
- you will also notice that some hallways and doors will now be blocked with gore and that the door you came from is now locked -> I hope you're good at lockpicking
- ignore the creature(s) and run downstairs to the basement and unlock the latch on the floor with the key you got from Julius' room
- Summil (another creature) patrols here, so avoid him as best as you can
- you need to grab the key to Garden that hangs on the chain above the table, then continue through the door right next to the table and eventually you'll get back to the main hall (ignore Summil)
- remember where the door to the courtyard was? -> area to the left of the stairs in main hall, ground floor where Julius appeared when you went into Marcus' room - you need to go into that hallway
- unlock door to courtyard with the key you got from the basement
- a pond and three dead dogs around, door leading to the North wing is locked -> another totem at the bottom of the pond (Blood Curse of Foam)

- Blood Curse of Foam:
	- this is a labyrinth of cells, full of -buros and some more notes with clues on the corpses
	- ignore the monsters and just try to find the way to the center where the Foaming Sage floats (it will keep blasting you with magic)
	- boss battle with Foaming Sage
	- after the battle dispel the altar -> receive key to Bruiant Mansion North Wing and teleport back to the courtyard
	
- unlock the door to North wing
- there is nothing much downstairs, so go upstairs -> Julius appears at the end of the hall
- there is a cupboard with a bloody skull and key right where Julius was standing -> grab the key -> unlocks the door to Bartholo's room right next to it
- Julius in the room, Bartholo's skeleton sitting by the table and blood everywhere -> another totem next to bed (Blood Curse of Chain) -> also, creatures start wandering around this part of the mansion now, too

- Blood Curse of Chain:
	- hide and seek game with Balaburos patrolling the way (alcoves for you to hide until they get past), some more awkward parkour to the bottom and one more hide and seek section
	- room with water and spikes in front of the cell door -> pull the 4 levers in the alcoves around the room (ignore -buros)
	- boss room with altar and Bartholo the Knight of Bloodrust -> boss battle
	- dispel the altar -> receive the key to Julia's room and teleport back to Bartholo's room

- run to Julia's room (go downstairs and find another way upstairs -> the hall you're in will be blocked with gore and undead mutated servants will now join the creatures you've already seen)
- unlock the door to Julia's room with the key you just got -> Julius next to bed and there are Julia's Journal and Marcus' Journal (4E 199) if you want some more clues
- wardrobe with a bloodstain in front of it -> there is another wardrobe to the right with a pull chain to the left of it -> pulling it will open the bloodstained wardrobe
- Julius on the stairs leading to the black door -> leads to Hidden Room
- the last altar/totem here (Blood Curse of Jealousy)

- Blood Curse of Jealousy:
	- this one is pretty straightforward -> trudge through the ankle deep sea of blood towards the ruins (optionally kill some -buros on the way)
	- Julia the Crimson guards the last altar -> boss fight
	- dispel the altar -> nothing received, just teleport back to the Hidden Room

- Bal waits for you and attacks you -> kill him and loot a key from him
- climb up the ladder above the altar (unlock with Bal's key)
- back in the main hall, Marcus' corpse is now gone and in its place is the corpse of Julius
- activating the corpse brings up the menu with a few options -> when you're ready, choose "Dispel dagger" option -> boss battle with Julius
- after the battle fire everywhere, doors won't open, you're still stuck aaaand guess who shows up again? (really, seeing Molag Bal after all of that is kind of a relief)
- oh, just talk to the smug bastard (he actually has a pretty epic (if short) rant on mortals and the Aedra if you ask him about a few things ... and he may actually have a point at least about the Aedra ... 
  and I can't believe I'm sort of agreeing with Molag Bal here ...)

- DECISION! 
- this time, however, there is no karma gain or loss -> you're deciding between life and death. Whose? Your own. Morally right or not, unless you're playing a complete paladin (and I don't know how you'll justify some of the stuff
  you had to do in act 1, if you do), I suggest you choose life (especially if your character is a Dragonborn and that way, you will at least have a very good reason for wanting some payback in act 4). It will make more sense than
  trying to come up with an explanation on why a Daedric Prince would be interested in a random average Joe in act 4 anyway. But hey, it's your choice. You'll end up in act 4 either way.
- LIFE:
	- accept Molag Bal's offer ("Fine, help me out of here." dialogue option) -> you can still tell him you don't deal with the Daedra before, but he'll just scoff at you and say his offer still stands
	- he'll laugh and conjure up an Oblivion gate (did you really expect he'll just kindly douse the fire and let you skip out of the front door?) -> go through it
	- act 3 completes here, continue this guide with ACT 4 (no, you're not skipping anything here - this is more or less the intended path)
- DEATH/MARTYRDOM:
	- either tell Molag Bal you don't deal with the Daedra or completely ignore him and don't talk to him at all
	- activate the bloodstain on the floor where Julius' corpse was before -> confirm that you want to die
	- that's it, you die (... ok, completely gameplay-wise, the game just teleports you back to the Temple of Stendarr and opens up a character creation menu, but the mod treats this as a completely new character - base Skyrim game
	  does not, since it's completely impossible to actually kill off your character for real and still continue playing)
	- quest completes (but not act 3), continue this guide with 2 - THE SUCCESSOR
	
### 2 - THE SUCCESSOR
- talk to Gwyneth and she'll send you to the Bruiant Mansion to find the Keeper (your "previous" character)
- activate the carriage outside the Temple 
- you can talk to M'que for some info, but otherwise everything around the mansion is completely empty and nobody waits for you
- very dark inside, a bunch of corpses of the Imperial Legion and a burnt corpse in the place where you martyred your "previous" character -> has all the inventory you had before ... also, you're stuck here now
- activate the Horn of Stendarr in front of the corpse
- scene changes, black water everywhere, the Black Hand and a few corrupted shades (including Julius) appear (you can talk to them for some cryptic lines) and a statue of Molag Bal in dragon form vomiting blood
- activate Molag Bal statue
- act 3 completes, continue to ACT 4

## ACT 4
> Note 1: You will have no quests visible in your journal and there will be no map markers. Talk to friendly NPCs - Pepe is your most reliable info desk who will show up at the most important points of the story. And let's say that your objective is to reach the tower in the middle, beat the living daylights out of Molag Bal and return to Skyrim.

> Note 2: You will be stuck here until you complete the quest, so if you're using any basic needs mods (like iNeed or similar), stock up on food and water - there is next to nothing here. Or prepare to starve. Your choice. Keep in mind you'll be here for quite some time, unless you're rushing with the game.

> Note 3: Karma is very important here. You gain it by helping friendly NPCs, defeating bosses and ending memory quests in a good way. You lose it by killing friendly NPCs, ending memory quests in a bad way, skipping previous acts and by trading with the Black Hand. You can check your current amount of karma by activating Eye of Marukh in your inventory.

> Note 4: When Eye of Marukh reacts to something, there is a memory quest available. 

> Note 5: WARNING FOR ARACHNOPHOBES! You will want to avoid the Hidden Cave of the Followers of Mara (and its Temple of Mara) if you decide to explore. You may still stumble over a lone spider or scorpion here and there, but that cave is absolutely swarming with spiders after a certain point. It's not central to the story, so you can skip that cave without any problems.

### 1 - COLDHARBOUR
- no matter how you got here, everything will play out the same now
- you wake up in Coldharbour with some tentacle faced creature (Pepe) already being grumpy with you (you may recognize his model as the Ascended Sleeper from Morrowind, though)
- answer him however you want, he'll be supremely unimpressed with you in any case, but you can still ask him for some general info and the ideas on what you're even supposed to do (get to the tower and Molag Bal)
- before you leave, loot Eye of Marukh from the little statue of Marukh right in front you when you woke up (Pepe tends to stand next to it)

- a word on Coldharbour: this is a new, pretty large worldspace with plenty of places to explore, but not all of them advance the story (most of them do have at least one boss battle, though)
- the shortest route is to start going clockwise around the island as soon as you can and then keep to that way:
	- start in Mathmalatu Priory (where you wake up)
	- Waterfront District -> steal or loot the key from the Scamp Captain up in one of the watchtowers
	- Fort Verin, Waterfront District -> defeat Vernaccus and get his key, unlock the gate out of Waterfront District
	- go towards the Gate of Varla until Menta Na attacks you -> get his key and unlock the gate
	- now start your clockwise journey around the island until you get to the Slums
	- Slums -> Slums 2nd Floor -> get key from the Great Beggar -> Beggar's Way
	- Prison Tower Sewers (you get here through Slums/Beggar's Way)
	- Prison Tower (you get here through the Sewers) -> Prison District -> cross the bridge to the inner part of the city
	- inner Imperial City, go clockwise again until you get to Curia Morimath
	- Curia Morimath -> kill Archpriest Centius and loot his key -> unlock the Golden Sanctuary here -> get the key for the Inquisition Court District here (it's inside the giant golden egg)
	- Inquisition Court District
	- Monastery of the Holy Brothers of Marukh -> defeat the last boss (Abbot Cosmas) and go through portal to Malada
	- Malada -> get to the last area and kill Marukh to drop the barrier around the center of the city
	- Malatar Mansion -> kill Dro'Zel and get his heart and key to central district
	- Sancremor Tower (really Molag Bal's version of White-Gold tower) -> ignore all the fighting (enemies spawn indefinitely) and just get to the top
- this shortest path does not guarantee you enough karma for anything but a bad ending, so go out on your own and explore -> for more details and description of every place you'll have to wait for my full guide, though

### 2 - AETHERIUS
- at the top of the tower you'll find Molag Bal behind his throne -> strike him down and loot Ada Bal from the ashes (no, you don't kill him - you can't kill a Daedric Prince!)
- place the Ada Bal on the set in the floor -> portal to Aetherius opens

- KARMA BELOW 50:
	- BAD ENDING
	- Molag Bal kills Stendarr and takes over his plane of Aetherius ... and it's all thanks to you (nonetheless, it's an awesome scene)
	- the end, you return to Skyrim (step into the light next to Molag Bal)
	
- KARMA 50 OR ABOVE:
	- CHANCE FOR A BETTER ENDING (or an even worse one, if you so choose)
	- when you step through the portal, you will see petrified Molag Bal -> activate him
	- teleport to Abyss of Molag Bal
	- continue this guide with 3 - EXSULTATE JUBILATE
	
### 3 - EXSULTATE JUBILATE
- go towards the tree with dark aura around it
- Eye of Marukh will react to two strange sand piles -> you can activate them and finish two memory quests (Pepe and Marukh)
- but you need to reach that tree
- Molag Bal sits below the tree and waits for you -> final boss battle (no, you STILL don't kill him - seriuosly, you CAN'T kill a Daedra!)
- after the battle go to the tree and activate that last strange sand pile -> Bard's memory and an ending

- **ENDINGS**:
	- **WORST/MOLAG BAL ENDING**:
		- tell Lamae whatever you want
		- go around the tree and activate the Spawn (ignore Lute)
		- answer Sheogorath with "Still..." dialogue option
		- go towards the throne and activate the red stone on it
	- **MADNESS/ALTANO ENDING**:
		- tell Lamae whatever you want
		- go around the tree and activate the Spawn (ignore Lute)
		- answer Sheogorath with "Enough..." dialogue option
		- follow the fox and activate the Shrine of Stendarr
	- **BITTER ENDING**:
		- tell Lamae there's nothing more to tell and that they all died
		- activate the lute
		- answer Molag Bal with whatever you want (he'll have a little comment on all 3 options)
		- NOTE: before you leave, you can strike Molag Bal down, loot his heart and eat it -> throws you to the WORST ENDING (and no, he's still not really dead but I'll be discussing lore and endings in the full guide)
	- **TRUE ENDING**:
		- tell Lamae you'll think of the end of the story until you meet again
		- activate the lute
		- answer Molag Bal with whatever you want (he'll have a little comment on all 3 options, but this time he'll be downright civil to you)
		
- in any case, you end up back in Aetherius -> go down the stairs to the shrine with light and it will teleport you back to Skyrim

### 4 - A MILLION CATS
- you wake up in the hunter's camp by the lake Ilinalta just below the Guardian Stones
- unless you got a really bad ending, you will meet Ja'zhan Jr here -> you can talk and trade with him, he'll also set up some story hooks for GLENMORIL (a spiritual successor mod to VIGILANT, currently still unfinished)

- you can return to the Temple of Stendarr, where Gwyneth will be worried sick about you
- a stone tablet on her table -> you can return to Coldharbour by activating it
- if you go back to Bruiant Mansion, you should meet a very grumpy Legion officer (Cato) who really just wants you gone from there (unless you martyred yourself, then nobody should be there)
- M'que will be happy to see you in any case
- act 4 completes here

VIGILANT is meant to be a solo adventure, and followers may be more trouble than they are worth. Also, taking these 7 out of Coldharbour would be ... story breaking. They are dead, you can't help them much.
